# uvsim
An educational virtual machine running BasicML

## Overview
UVSim is a virtual machine implemented in Python for computer science students to learn machine language and computer architecture.

The VM runs a low-level language called BasicML to help students learn the basic concepts behind assembly and machine languages.

## Hardware
UVSim contains a CPU, main memory, and registers, including an accumulator to store the results of operations before saving to memory.

## BasicML
The entirety of BasicML is specified as follows:

### I/O operations:

READ = 10 Read a word from the keyboard into a specific location in memory.

WRITE = 11 Write a word from a specific location in memory to screen.

### Load/store operations:

LOAD = 20 Load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator.

STORE = 21 Store a word from the accumulator into a specific location in memory.

### Arithmetic operations:

ADD = 30 Add a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator)

SUBTRACT = 31 Subtract a word from a specific location in memory from the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator)

DIVIDE = 32 Divide the word in the accumulator by a word from a specific location in memory (leave the result in the accumulator).

MULTIPLY = 33 multiply a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator).

### Control operations:

BRANCH = 40 Branch to a specific location in memory

BRANCHNEG = 41 Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is negative.

BRANCHZERO = 42 Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero.

HALT = 43 Stop the program

The last two digits of a BasicML instruction are the operand â€“ the address of the memory location containing the word to which the operation applies
