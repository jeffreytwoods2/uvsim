# uvsim
An educational virtual machine running BasicML

## Overview
UVSim is a virtual machine implemented in Python for computer science students to learn machine language and computer architecture.

The VM runs a low-level language called BasicML to help students learn the basic concepts behind assembly and machine languages.

## Hardware
UVSim contains a CPU, main memory, and registers, including an accumulator to store the results of operations before saving to memory.

## BasicML
The entirety of BasicML is specified as follows:

### I/O operations:

READ = 10 Read a word from the keyboard into a specific location in memory.

WRITE = 11 Write a word from a specific location in memory to screen.

### Load/store operations:

LOAD = 20 Load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator.

STORE = 21 Store a word from the accumulator into a specific location in memory.

### Arithmetic operations:

ADD = 30 Add a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator)

SUBTRACT = 31 Subtract a word from a specific location in memory from the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator)

DIVIDE = 32 Divide the word in the accumulator by a word from a specific location in memory (leave the result in the accumulator).

MULTIPLY = 33 multiply a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator (leave the result in the accumulator).

### Control operations:

BRANCH = 40 Branch to a specific location in memory

BRANCHNEG = 41 Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is negative.

BRANCHZERO = 42 Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero.

HALT = 43 Stop the program

The last two digits of a BasicML instruction are the operand â€“ the address of the memory location containing the word to which the operation applies

## Getting Started on uvsim:

Note: In order to run this software, you will need Python installed on you local machine.

### 1. Installing uvsim:

From uvsim's root page on github, click on the green __<> Code__ button. This will open up a small menu. At the bottom of the menu, click __Download ZIP__. This will download all of the necessary files onto your local machine. Go ahead and extract them into a directory of your choice.

### 2. Start Running uvsim:

To run uvsim, start by opening a new terminal or command line window. Then, navigate to the __uvsim_master__ directory. The location of this directory will depend on where you extracted the __.zip__ file. Finally, run the command `python3 main.py`. If this doesn't work, you can also try replacing __python3__ with just __python__, or whichever version of python you have installed. 

### 3. Using uvsim:

Once the software is running, it will start by asking you to input a path for your input file. Simply input the path to the file that you would like uvsim to process. Check the files in __test_files__ to get an idea of what the input file should look like. Note that the format for each line of you input file should be either `+` or `-`, followed by any 4 digits. Once you've given uvsim a valid file to process, it will run through each line of that file, and then display its final state in the terminal once processing is complete.
